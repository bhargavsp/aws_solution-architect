# Serverless

## what is serverless
1. Server-less does not mean there are no servers... it means you just don't manage / provision / see them
2. Initially... Serverless FaaS (Function as a Service)
3. Serverless was pioneered by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything that's managed: "databases, messaging, storage, etc."
