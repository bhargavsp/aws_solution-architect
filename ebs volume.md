## What is EBS 
1. It is an Network drive(not a physical drive) that is attached to the EC2 instance
2. we can terminate the instance and attach the same EBS volume to the other instance and we get our data back
3. Amazon EBS Multi-Attach feature enables you to attach a single Provisioned EBS , IOPS SSD ( io1 or io2 ) volume to multiple instances that are in the same Availability Zone.
4. To use the attached EBS volume to the instance, Its bit complicated, so follow the link https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-using-volumes.html
